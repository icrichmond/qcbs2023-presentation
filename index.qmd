## Urban (re)development is social

## Benefits of parks are complex but important

## How do complicated histories interact with park benefits?

::: incremental
1.  Do the communities surrounding parks differ socio-demographically by past land-use type? If so, do these differences continue legacies of environmental racism?
2.  What are the legacy effects of past land-use types on current park capacity to provide a temperature mitigation, a critical benefit?

## The "Luxury Effect" around our parks

In the neighbourhoods surrounding our parks we see:

-   Lower proportions of visible minorities

-   Higher proportions of highly educated people

-   Higher incomes (**except in previously industrial parks**)

-   More single detached homes (**except in previously industrial parks**)

## Cooling effect is similar across park types

## Forests are similar across park types

## Tree density drives cooling effect

## Let's put parks everywhere! (with thought and community-led policy)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Park cooling happens everywhere

-   Legacy effects still dominate close to parks

-   Parks in industrial areas have the potential to increase equity, *if done correctly*
